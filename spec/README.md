# Where are the specs?

This project is following its own principles, and taking a lead from golang in that:

The specs are co-located as much as possible with their implementation.

I.e. they are in `lib/**/*_spec.rb`

There are some integration specs because they don't have a clear place to live
side by side with the code.
